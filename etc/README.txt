INSTALLATION - WINDOWS

By executing the file setup.vbs a shortcut will be created on the desktop. It
points to the actual installation directory, thus will become invalid if latter
gets moved. Depending on the Java installation you should either use setup.vbs
or setup64.vbs. Latter is is only necessary if a 32bit Java is present on a
64bit Windows, which is the standard though these days (because of the usage of
32bit web browsers).

INSTALLATION - LINUX

To launch TruPax use the executable trupaxgui, which you can also use e.g. in
GNOME in a starter, together with the program icon trupax_icon.png. If you have
administrative rights on the system you may try the install.sh shell script,
which installs everything into /opt/trupax, creates a starter automatically and
also enables the command trupax on the command line. In the installation
directory there is the script uninstall.sh, which you can use to remove the
software completely.
